## Plan a Route
1. Note: This app is based on the idea that if you are heading for the destination, you will get there by any route.
  * If you want to get to the destination as fast as possible, use a navigation app.
1. **Put a pin at each of your destinations by long pressing the point on the map.**
  * You can search for a place by selecting [Search for Place !(magnifyingglass)] in the menu !(ellipsis.circle).
  * The distance from your location to the destination is a rough estimate without considering the route.
  * If you want to take a particular road, put a pin at the start point of it, too.
